            Proposed a sampling-based bi-level planning algorithm for non-holonomic constrained robots to achieve aggressive maneuvers.The global problem is tackled by solving locally and in parallel within the highly-constrained regions of the state space, then refined globally.

                <li>
                  Explore in the holonomic space to identify regions with constraints.

                <li>
                   Sampling configurations with maximum margins within each constrained region in parallel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify the escape velocity for each constrained region and generated local trajectories within each region that satisfy the non-holonomic constraints.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Integrate trajectories into a single trajectory and refine it.
