**PART 1：**
In this project, I developed and trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to navigate a simulated 2D maze environment. Utilizing an agent-based model, the project integrated dynamics, control systems, and machine learning to enable autonomous navigation towards a designated goal. The task complexity was heightened by randomizing the spawn locations of both the agent and the goal, and by incorporating multiple obstacle maps. The machine learning models were trained using human-generated data, where an expert user provided demonstrations through keyboard controls. This research illustrates the intersection of neural networks and robotics for complex autonomous navigation tasks.
