    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: WELL Lab in University of Wisconsin-Madison
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Developed a novel robotic system, PogoX, that seamlessly integrates a quadrotor with a spring-loaded leg, enabling aerial vehicles to 
          perform terrestrial locomotion under heavy payloads
        - Engineered a decoupled control strategy that employs vertical height control through a quadratic program-based energy shaping and 
          horizontal velocity control inspired by step-to-step dynamics, achieving robust hopping under varying conditions.
        - Overcame traditional limitations of quadrotors by incorporating a spring-loaded leg, expanding the operational envelope and paving 
          the way for versatile applications in complex environments.

      institution: ROAR Lab in Columbia University
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Evaluated different EMG pattern classification algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine 
          (SVM), and Deep Neural Network(DNN) to classify the EMG signals into different head-neck movements and achieved 86.5% 
          accuracy using ConvRNN Classification method
        - Detected a motor impaired user's intention to execute specific head movements based on neck muscles EMG and implemented 
          selected machine learning algorithm into neck brace's control system and tested it on ALS patients in real-time.

      institution: Sichuan University
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Unveiled groundbreaking strategies to reduce CO, NOx, and UHC emissions by 90% in both low and high thermal intensity scenarios, 
          fundamentally redefining clean energy benchmarks for MILD combustion in cylindrical furnaces.
        - Validated a novel reactor network calculation method for C3H8/air MILD combustion, setting a precedent for accurate and effective 
          modeling in the extension of MILD combustion systems to high-power applications like boilers and gas turbines.
        - Deciphered the complex relationships between furnace geometry and operational conditions, laying the groundwork for highly efficient 
          and environmentally-friendly power generation solutions.
